#0505:

work:
rewrite the robot_description's ceshi.cpp, which can subscribe odom and manipulator controller state,and then use the control strategy
add connection between mobile_manipulator'base_move.py and robot_description's ceshi.cpp
got end effector's state in txt file and plot the data
add 1st edition dwa algorithm

problems:
the velocity of the base changes suddenly,which may cause the error of the end effector
the joint position is larger than the max or smaller than min. need to find a better way to plan the base trajectory.

#0506:

work:
found some problems that were not noticed,such as the transform from mm velocity to manipulator velocity. add the velocity casused by the rotation of the base
changed the planner. add searching guidence according to the trajectory velocity
tested the dwa algorithm and correct some errors. now it can work normally.
added a fig that describes the dwa results

problems:
the dwa algorithm cannot follow the trajectory accurately,probably the goal function needs to be improved. or it is okay now,the errors can be ignored
the manipulator will go to singularity when moving based the given control method. probably the highest manipulability point is closed to the singularity
it need to be conformed.
a new way to chose the point:according to the manipulability area,which can be described as the radius of the ball,not the manipulability directly

#0509

work:
 rewrite the planner.py using the max area with good manipulability method,

#0510:

 work:
 test the new planner,
 came out a new method to plan the trajectory real time. like the dwa algorithm, sample in the velocity demain, predict the posible position and give a goal function to evaluate current sample result,find the best to pub
 

 problems:
 the new planner always focuse on the current best place, sometimes next position will have no ik solution,needs to be improved
