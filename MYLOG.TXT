0505:

work:
rewrite the robot_description's ceshi.cpp, which can subscribe odom and manipulator controller state,and then use the control strategy
add connection between mobile_manipulator'base_move.py and robot_description's ceshi.cpp
got end effector's state in txt file and plot the data
add 1st edition dwa algorithm

problems:
the velocity of the base changes suddenly,which may cause the error of the end effector
the joint position is larger than the max or smaller than min. need to find a better way to plan the base trajectory.
